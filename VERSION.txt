TO DO:
    - Changing location inside normal OE window does not record in History text
    - Sigma-Aldrich cannot be accessed from A2 Hosting?????

2019-07-03:
    - fixed bug in Terminal mode: barcodeTerminalAsync.php and lib_language_en.php
        while doing inventory for a container (inventory mode or "Set storage 
        for all following containers"), if you scan a non-existing barcode, 
        the location will be removed. When a non-existent barcode is scanned,
        an error pop-up window appears.
    - modified History log text to add storage_name; also added History log text
        when changing storage in edit mode (lib_db_manip.php, lib_db_manip_edit.php)

2019-06-11:
    - import.php, lib_import.php: added importing function for locations and
        users using tab-separated text file
    - lib_import.php: fix for importing chemical_storage_barcode bug. 
        When import tab-dilimited text file of chemical containers, if the
        barcode column is the last column, it will add white space or \n
        character, making the barcodes inaccurate. The fix will trim all the
        white space (\t\n) on the right side of the input column
    - topnav.php, style.css.php, lib_global_funcs.php, lib_sidenav_funcs.php
        sidenav.php: edited some fonts, styles

        user barcodes while using "Existing barcodes" functions

2019-05-25
    - lib_db_manip.php: edit logging text to reflect chemical containers when 
    being moved from one location to another
